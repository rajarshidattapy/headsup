# NetWatch

![img](img.png)

**Real-time network security observability for macOS endpoints.**

NetWatch is a terminal-based security monitoring tool that gives you continuous, live visibility into every active network connection on your machine with automatic risk scoring, GeoIP intelligence, VPN status, process path validation, and new-connection alerting. Built for security-conscious individuals, developers, and teams who need to know exactly what their machine is talking to and why.

---

## Overview

Modern endpoints make hundreds of concurrent network connections. Most security tools surface this data only after an incident. NetWatch surfaces it in real time — with enough context to act on it immediately.

Every second, NETWATCH:

- Enumerates all active TCP/UDP connections via the OS kernel
- Resolves the owning process and validates its executable path
- Scores each connection's risk level using a multi-factor algorithm
- Looks up the geographic origin of every external IP in the background
- Detects new connections the moment they appear
- Monitors VPN tunnel status and alerts when traffic is exposed

---

## Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+, macOS (Linux compatible with minor limitations)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyegomez/netwatch
cd netwatch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Standard mode
python3 netwatch.py

# Full process visibility (recommended)
sudo python3 netwatch.py

# With DNS hostname resolution for remote IPs
sudo python3 netwatch.py --resolve
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

## Features

### System Dashboard
Live header panel showing the full network context of your machine, updated every second:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| VPN Status | Detects active tunnel interfaces (`utun`, `tun`, `wg`, `ppp`, `ipsec`). Border turns red when no VPN is active. |
| Host / Local IP | Hostname and primary interface IP |
| Public IP | Your external IP, resolved via background fetch, cached for 60s |
| WiFi SSID | Active wireless network name (macOS) |
| Default Gateway | Network gateway IP |
| DNS Servers | Active nameservers from `/etc/resolv.conf` |
| Bytes Sent / Received | Cumulative throughput since boot |

### Connection Table
Live-updated table with one row per active connection:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| FLAGS | `★` new connection (appeared within 6s), `⚠` suspicious process path |
| RISK | Three-tier risk rating: `HIGH`, `MED`, `LOW` — automatically calculated |
| PROTO | TCP or UDP |
| STATUS | Full TCP state (`ESTABLISHED`, `LISTEN`, `SYN_SENT`, `TIME_WAIT`, etc.) |
| LOCAL | Local address and port |
| REMOTE | Remote IP address |
| COUNTRY | GeoIP country lookup — resolved in background, cached per session |
| PORT | Port number with well-known service label |
| PROCESS | Owning process name. Red + `⚠` prefix if binary runs from a suspicious path |
| PID | Process ID |

### Automatic Risk Scoring

Each connection is scored across multiple dimensions:

**Port base score**

| Score | Ports |
|-------|-------|
| 4 | Telnet (23), FTP (21) — plaintext legacy protocols |
| 3 | RDP (3389) — remote desktop, high-value target |
| 2 | SSH (22), SMTP (25), MySQL (3306), PostgreSQL (5432), MongoDB (27017), Redis (6379) |
| 1 | HTTP (80), HTTP-Alt (8080), unknown ports |
| 0 | HTTPS (443, 8443), DNS (53) |

**Modifier conditions**

| Condition | Score delta |
|-----------|-------------|
| External IP + `ESTABLISHED` | +1 |
| `LISTEN` on `0.0.0.0` or `::` (all interfaces) | +1 |
| `SYN_SENT` to external IP | +1 |
| Process binary in suspicious path | +2 |

**Rating thresholds:** `≥ 4` → `HIGH`, `≥ 2` → `MED`, `< 2` → `LOW`

### New Connection Detection
Every connection is tracked by a `(local_addr, remote_addr, pid)` key with a first-seen timestamp. Connections that appeared within the last 6 seconds are flagged with `★` and a highlighted row background. The highlight expires automatically.

### GeoIP Intelligence
Remote IP geographic lookups run in background threads via `ip-api.com` and are cached per session. Private/RFC 1918 addresses resolve immediately as `local`. Results appear in the COUNTRY column as they arrive.

### Process Path Validation
The full executable path of each process is inspected. Binaries making network connections from the following locations are flagged as suspicious and receive a +2 risk penalty:

- `/tmp/`, `/private/tmp/`, `/var/tmp/`
- `/var/folders/`
- `Downloads/`, `Desktop/`

Standard system paths (`/usr/`, `/System/`, `/Applications/`, `/Library/Application Support/`) are not flagged.

### VPN Status
Network interfaces are scanned each tick for active tunnel adapters. When no VPN is detected, the system panel border turns red and a warning is displayed inline. Detects WireGuard (`wg`), OpenVPN (`tun`), macOS VPN (`utun`), IPSec (`ipsec`), PPP, and TAP adapters.

### Statistics Panel
A live sidebar showing:
- Risk summary (HIGH / MED / LOW counts)
- Connection breakdown by TCP state
- Top 6 processes by connection count

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- macOS (Linux compatible with minor limitations — WiFi SSID and gateway detection use macOS-specific tooling)
- Root access recommended for full process visibility

**Dependencies:**
```
psutil>=5.9
rich>=13.0
```

## Display Reference

### Risk Indicators

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `● HIGH` | High-risk connection — immediate attention recommended |
| `◆ MED` | Medium-risk — monitor and investigate if unexpected |
| `○ LOW` | Low-risk — encrypted or local traffic |

### Flag Column

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `★` | New connection — appeared within the last 6 seconds |
| `⚠` | Suspicious process — binary executing from a high-risk path |

### VPN Border Color

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Cyan | VPN tunnel active — traffic is protected |
| Red | No VPN detected — traffic is exposed on current network |

### Connection Status Colors

| Color | States |
|-------|--------|
| Bold green | `ESTABLISHED` |
| Bold cyan | `LISTEN` |
| Bold magenta | `SYN_SENT` |
| Yellow | `TIME_WAIT`, `CLOSE_WAIT` |
| Dim | `FIN_WAIT`, `LAST_ACK`, `CLOSING`, `CLOSE` |

## Architecture

NETWATCH is a single-file Python script with no external services, no telemetry, and no persistent storage. All data is gathered locally from the OS kernel via `psutil`. The only outbound requests are:

1. **Public IP lookup** — one HTTPS request to `api.ipify.org` on startup, refreshed every 60 seconds
2. **GeoIP lookups** — one HTTP request to `ip-api.com` per unique external IP, cached for the session lifetime

All lookups run in daemon threads and never block the render loop. If either service is unavailable (e.g. on a restricted network), the tool degrades gracefully — displaying `unavailable` or `…` in the affected fields while all local monitoring continues uninterrupted.

---

## Threat Coverage

| Threat | Detection mechanism |
|--------|---------------------|
| Unencrypted outbound traffic | Port scoring — HTTP/FTP/Telnet flagged HIGH or MED |
| Exposed local services | LISTEN on `0.0.0.0` scored higher than localhost-bound services |
| Suspicious process origin | Binary path validation — temp/download directories flagged |
| Unexpected new connections | First-seen timestamp tracking with 6-second visual TTL |
| VPN tunnel failure | Interface scan every render tick |
| Remote desktop exposure | RDP (3389) port score = 3, external + established = HIGH |
| Database exposure | MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis all scored MED minimum |
| Compromised process from temp | `/tmp` binary + external connection = HIGH |

---

## Limitations

- Per-connection bandwidth measurement is not currently implemented — total interface throughput is shown in the header
- GeoIP accuracy depends on `ip-api.com` data quality; CDN and VPN exit IPs may show unexpected countries
- WiFi SSID and gateway detection use macOS-specific commands (`airport`, `route`) and will not work on Linux without modification
- Full process visibility (executable paths, process names for all PIDs) requires root on macOS
- `ip-api.com` has a rate limit of 45 requests/minute on the free tier; sessions with many unique external IPs may see delayed GeoIP resolution

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] IP reputation lookup against AbuseIPDB / threat intel feeds
- [ ] Per-process bandwidth metering (KB/s per connection)
- [ ] Anomaly baseline — alert on first-ever outbound connection per process
- [ ] Port scan / sweep detection (multiple ports from same remote IP)
- [ ] DNS leak detection (DNS traffic bypassing VPN resolver)
- [ ] Connection history log (JSONL append with timestamp, risk, process)
- [ ] `--alert` mode — system notification on HIGH-risk connection
- [ ] Linux support (SSID via `iwgetid`, gateway via `ip route`)
